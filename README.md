‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This project uses a dual-license strategy: GPLv3 for open community use, and BSL 1.1 to delay production/commercial use until 2028. After that, all code becomes fully GPLv3. The project encourages community contributions and will always offer a free software pathway.


## Features

- Intelligent packet filtering
- Memory-safe buffer handling
- Real-time logging to file or stdout
- Categorized logs (system vs captured data)
- Easy to embed in low-latency environments

## Log Categories

Frame Logger currently provides two types of log outputs:

1. **Tool Logs** ‚Äî Internal logs generated by the logger engine  
2. **Captured Logs** ‚Äî Raw or filtered packet logs

Each log entry is timestamped and categorized for easier post-processing.


## Developer Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you're working on the code, please follow these core principles:

- **Thread Safety** ‚Äî Shared variables across functions must be properly synchronized.
- **Minimal Dependencies** ‚Äî Avoid adding heavy external libraries unless absolutely necessary.
- **Test First** ‚Äî All new features should include relevant unit tests.

# Donations & Funding
